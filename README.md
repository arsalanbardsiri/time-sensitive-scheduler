# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Welcome to the Work Day Scheduler! This web application is designed to help you manage your workday more effectively by providing a simple calendar app for scheduling your tasks and events. The scheduler allows you to add important events for each hour of a typical working day (9 am – 5 pm) and saves them locally so you can access them later.

2. The scheduler should present time blocks for standard business hours (9 am – 5 pm).
3. Each time block should be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. The user should be able to enter an event by clicking into a time block.
5. The user should be able to save the event by clicking the "Save" button for that time block.
6. Saved events should persist even after the page is refreshed.
